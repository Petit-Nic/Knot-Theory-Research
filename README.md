# Knot-Theory-Research
A repo containing the code developed in my knot theory research.

## Purpose
This code was created from scratch by me to assist in my mathematical research in knot theory. Due to my interest in finite-type invariants of virtual knots and tangles, the code mostly revolves around coding Gauss diagrams/codes for virtual knots and links, with optional labelings, and use said representations to compute the Affine Index Polynomial (as defined in the author's papers) for arbitrary examples and labelings.

## Contents
In its first commit, there is only one main file, GaussDiag.py, containing all the code for the above purposes. It is the author's intention to restructure this in a more appropriate python package, and potentially split the Gauss code generation and drawing from the invariant computations in due time.
